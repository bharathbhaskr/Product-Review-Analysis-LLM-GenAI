# Product Review Analysis using LLM & Gen-AI

This project analyzes customer reviews for various products using advanced natural language processing techniques and machine learning models. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), sentiment analysis, and predictive modeling to uncover trends and actionable insights.

## Project Structure

- **Data Cleaning**: Removal of special characters, stop words, tokenization, and lemmatization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Insights into customer age groups, review lengths, product categories, and rating distributions.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Using machine learning models to classify review sentiments.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Applying linear discriminant analysis to predict customer sentiments based on reviews.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bharathbhaskr/Product-Review-Analysis-LLM-GenAI.git
   ```
2. Install the necessary Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook or run the notebook in Google Colab:
   - Open the notebook directly in Google Colab by clicking the "Open in Colab" badge.

4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute data cleaning, EDA, and machine learning models.

## Results

The analysis provides key insights into customer preferences, sentiment distribution, and product review trends. The LDA model allows us to predict review sentiments and uncover hidden patterns within the data.
